# Applied Math

A linear programming project (done in TypeScript or Java—I haven’t decided
yet—instead of Microsoft Excel’s Solver) that, given an initial body type that
will change various constraint values and objective weights, will generate a
diet and exercise routine to optimize for gaining muscle mass, staying lean,
etc (I’ll have multiple different objective functions depending on what the
person wants to do).
